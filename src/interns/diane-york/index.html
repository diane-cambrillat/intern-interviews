                <h2>Why is this photo meaningful to me?</h2>
                <p>This picture was taken in front of the shores of Palau, in the Pacific Ocean. It was the first time we saw land after 3 weeks on the sea. I was onboard a research cruise for the University of Tokyo. You can see the whole research team. This trip was one of the most amazing and challenging experience of my life.

                <h2>About me</h2>
               <p>Originally from the Paris region in France, my curiosity has always pushed me to see the world. I have lived by myself in 4 different countries (France, Peru, Japan, and the USA). I can speak 3 languages fluently (French, English, and Spanish) and I am always excited to learn new (foreign and programming!) languages. I also travelled a lot in Europe and Africa to develop the business of the two companies I have been working for during the past 6 years. My communication, pugnacity and dedication to the companies’ success were the keys to increase their sales by €6M per year for UGPBAN and €5M (+20% increased revenue) for Exofarm, a branch of Compagnie Fruitiere Group. My employers not only trusted me to take care of important client and supplier accounts, they also offered me the opportunity to oversee sensitive projects such as the transition to a new ERP system and data visualization tool.

                    <h2>What do I want to learn during the internship?</h2>
                        <p>This internship would be an opportunity for me to work along experienced software engineers and take my coding skills to the next level. I am expecting to face many technical challenges and I am very excited about that because I love challenges. I know what it is like to work with software engineers but as a client. This time I will be on the other side of the line, where I belong. </p>
                        <p><b><center>I look forward to discussing the Software Engineer Intern position, and my performance at this coding challenge!</center> </b></p>

           <h2>Why do I want to be a software engineer?</h2>
           <p>I have a Master’s degree in science and I have experience in scientific research. I have a very analytical mind. I like math, logical problems and dealing with data. These skills were very useful to perform in sales, but they were the keys to my success in the ERP system transition project. I had to make sure the ERP system would meet the user’s needs and requirements, and design data visualization (KPI dashboards) on the new software (Qlikview). I loved this experience. I had great satisfaction when I was seeing users enjoying using their new tools in a more efficient way, especially people who were not comfortable with new technology. I understand user needs and how good technology can increase a company’s performance by saving time, facilitating the visualization of data and increasing employee’s work satisfaction. </p>
           <p>Even if I had a lot of fun and success in selling and buying mangoes and bananas, I knew that I belonged to a more technical field, creating software to make other people’s work more enjoyable and efficient. </p>
